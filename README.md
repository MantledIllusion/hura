# Hura
Hura is a dependency injection framework focused on sequential injection and bean lifecycle management.

Hura Crepitans, also called 'Sandbox Tree' and nicknamed 'Dynamite Tree', is a plant mainly living in South America. Its fruits are pumpkin-shaped capsules that undergo huge amounts of tension when drying out during dry season. On the first rain, when the surface of the fruit gets wet and softens up, the dry seeds inside break through the shell with a loud bang, being sling-shotted over a distance for more than 300 feet.

### Hura Core

Contains the generic core of the injection framework and most of its functionality around injection, property resolving and bean life cycle handling.

### Hura Web

Combines Hura Core with Java's Servlet API 4 for building deployable web application WARs.

### Hura WebLaunch
